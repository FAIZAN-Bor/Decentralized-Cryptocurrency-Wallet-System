FINAL PROJECT REQUIREMENTS
Project Title:
“Decentralized Cryptocurrency Wallet System with Blockchain, UTXO, PoW, Digital Signatures & Rust/Go Backend”

1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
Students are required to build a fully functional decentralized cryptocurrency wallet application, consisting of:
•	A custom blockchain implementation
•	Real cryptographic digital signatures
•	A UTXO-based transaction model
•	Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining
•	Wallet ID generation using public/private key pairs
•	A complete domestic-style money transfer system
•	Monthly Zakat deduction (2.5%)
•	System logging, analytics, reports
•	A React + Tailwind front-end
•	A Rust or Go backend (strict requirement, Choose the language best suited here)
•	A serverless database for storing chain data, users, logs, wallets, and transactions
________________________________________
2. TECHNOLOGY REQUIREMENTS
Frontend (Mandatory)
•	React
•	Tailwind CSS
•	No other UI framework allowed.
Backend (Mandatory)
You must choose ONE:
•	Rust
•	Go
	Node.js, Python, PHP, Csharp, Java, or any other backend languages are not allowed.
(Choose the language best suited for this project for backend)

Database (Allowed Serverless Databases Only)
•	Supabase (PostgreSQL)
	I’m using Supabase Database for this project.

3. FULL SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
3.1 User Accounts & Authentication
Every user must have:
Signup Requirements
•	Email + OTP verification
(Implement OTP with Firebase Auth, Supabase Auth, or custom email service)
•	Google OAuth login
User Profile Must Contain:
•	Full Name
•	Email
•	CNIC / National ID
•	Wallet ID (auto-generated, unique, non-editable)
•	Public Key
•	Private Key (encrypted using AES/RSA or similar)
•	Beneficiary List
•	Zakat deduction tracking
Profile Management
Users may update:
•	Name
•	Email (requires re-verification)
•	Beneficiary Wallet IDs
•	Security settings
________________________________________

3.2 Wallet System & Balance Logic
Wallet Mandatory Features
•	Wallet ID generated by hashing the public key
•	Wallet ID must be used in all transactions
•	If a wallet ID does not exist → return error: Invalid Wallet ID
Balance Calculation Rule
•	The system must use a UTXO model (Bitcoin-style)
•	Balance = sum of all unspent UTXOs
•	DB may store cached balance but must always validate through UTXO recalculation
Monthly Zakat System (Mandatory)
•	Automatically calculate 2.5% monthly deduction
•	Deduct from user’s balance
•	Transfer to “Zakat Pool” wallet
•	Generate a blockchain block for this deduction
•	Log event in system logs
•	Add a system transaction with type = "zakat_deduction"

3.3 Blockchain Requirements
Students must implement a real blockchain including:
•	Block structure
•	Hash computation (SHA-256)
•	Previous-hash linking
•	Proof-of-Work with adjustable difficulty
•	Blockchain validation
•	UTXO management
•	Digital signature verification
•	Double-spend prevention
•	Pending transaction pool
•	Mining reward system (bonus)
________________________________________

3.4 Block Structure (Mandatory Fields)
Every block must include:
Field	Description
index	Block number
timestamp	Time of block creation
transactions[]	Array of verified transactions
previous_hash	Hash of previous block
nonce	PoW nonce
hash	Final SHA-256 hash
merkle_root	Recommended
Hashing Requirements:
•	Entire block must be hashed using SHA-256
•	Hash must begin with "00000" (difficulty adjustable)
________________________________________

3.5 Transactions & UTXO Model
Transaction Mandatory Fields
Each transaction must include:
1.	Sender Wallet ID
2.	Receiver Wallet ID
3.	Amount
4.	Optional note/message
5.	Timestamp
6.	Sender Public Key
7.	Digital Signature
8.	UTXOs being spent
9.	Newly generated UTXO
10.	Change UTXO (if applicable)

Digital Signature Logic
The signed payload must include:
senderID + receiverID + amount + timestamp + note
Sign using:
•	Sender’s private key
Verify using:
•	Sender’s public key
If signature invalid → reject transaction
Double-Spend Prevention
•	Each UTXO can be spent only once
•	After spending: mark as spent in DB
•	System must block attempts to reuse it
________________________________________
3.6 Database Requirements
Must store:
•	Users
•	Wallets
•	UTXOs
•	Pending transactions
•	Mined blocks
•	Zakat deductions
•	System logs
•	Transaction logs
Database Processing Rules
Before approving a transaction:
1.	Fetch sender details
2.	Validate wallet ID existence
3.	Validate digital signature
4.	Validate sender has enough balance
5.	Compute PoW
6.	Insert transaction in DB
7.	Update UTXOs
After block is mined:
•	Move pending transactions → mined block
•	Mark associated UTXOs as spent

3.7 Logs, Reporting & History
Transaction Logs
Store:
•	Action (sent, received, mined, zakat deducted)
•	Timestamp
•	Block hash
•	Status
•	IP address
•	Note
System Logs
Log:
•	Login attempts
